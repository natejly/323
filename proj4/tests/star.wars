       ANOTHER galaxy, another time.

       The Old Republic was the Republic of legend, greater than distance
  or time.  No need to note where it was or whence it came, only to know
  that ... it was THE Republic

       Once, under the wise rule of the Senate and the protection of the
  Jedi Knights, the Republic throve and grew.  But as often happens when
  wealth and power pass beyond the admirable and attain the awesome, then
  appear those evil ones who have greed to match.

       So it was with the Republic at its height.  Like the greatest of
  trees, able to withstand any external attack, the Republic rotted from
  within though the danger was not visible from outside.

       Aided and abetted by restless, power-hungry individuals within the
  government, and the massive organs of commerce, the ambitious Senator
  Palpatine caused himself to be elected President of the Republic.  He
  promised to reunite the disaffected among the people and to restore the
  remembered glory of the Republic.

       Once secure in office he declared himself Emperor, shutting
  himself away from the populace.  Soon he was controlled by the very
  assistants and bootlickers he had appointed to high office, and the
  cries of the people for justice did not reach his ears.

       Having exterminated through treachery and deception the Jedi
  Knights, guardians of justice in the galaxy, the Imperial governors and
  bureaucrats prepared to institute a reign of terror among the
  disheartened worlds of the galaxy.  Many used the imperial forces and
  the name of the increasingly isolated Emperor to further their own
  personal ambitions

       But a small number of systems rebelled at these new outrages.
  Declaring themselves opposed to the New Order they began the great
  battle to restore the Old Republic.

       From the beginning they were vastly outnumbered by the systems
  held in thrall by the Emperor.  In those first dark days it seemed
  certain the bright flame of resistance would be extinguished before it
  could cast the light of new truth across a galaxy of oppressed and
  beaten peoples ...
