After opening the .zip file:
1. The hw1-tests.pl file, hw1-tests folder, include-files folder should be in the same directory as your executable
2. You need 5 total files to run this script: your exe, ref exe, .pl script, 2 .txt file folders.
3. You may have to give the hw1-tests.pl file executable permissions. Use the command: "chmod +x hw1-tests.pl"
4. Use the command "perl hw1-tests.pl" to run the testing script.

The hw1-tests.pl script uses the reference executable and your executable and compares their outputs.

PLEASE NOTE:
1. You MUST download the reference executable into the same directory as your executable.
2. I named my reference executable "ref", but you can just change this in the test script. I have also included the most
   updated version (as of 9/10/24) of the reference exec. to this zip file.
3. I named my program executable "proj1", but you can also change this in the test script.
4. The script does not output the differences between the outputs, so please go check the corresponding input file 
   if the script says that you failed a certain test.
5. Any tests that start with e-* just indicate that the program expects an error to be thrown.
